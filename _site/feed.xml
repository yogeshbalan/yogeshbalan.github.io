<p>With 6 years of dedicated experience in Android app development, I have honed my skills in creating robust and user-friendly applications. Throughout my career, I have worked on a wide range of projects, collaborating with cross-functional teams and delivering successful solutions. Here is an overview of my technical expertise:</p>

<p><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> I am highly proficient in Java and Kotlin, the primary languages for Android app development. I leverage their power and flexibility to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.</p>

<p><strong>Android Development Tools:</strong> I have extensive experience working with industry-standard tools such as Android Studio, which provides a comprehensive development environment. I utilize the Android SDK (Software Development Kit), including APIs, libraries, and frameworks, to build feature-rich and interactive applications.</p>

<p><strong>UI/UX Design and Material Design Guidelines:</strong> I have a deep understanding of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design principles. I apply Google’s Material Design guidelines to create visually appealing and intuitive interfaces that enhance user engagement and satisfaction.</p>

<p><strong>Backend Integration and APIs:</strong> I have expertise in integrating Android applications with backend services and APIs. I am well-versed in utilizing technologies like RESTful APIs, JSON, and XML for seamless data exchange between the app and server.</p>

<p><strong>Database Management:</strong> I have worked with popular databases like SQLite and Room, implementing efficient data storage and retrieval mechanisms in Android apps. I am skilled in designing and managing database schemas and performing complex queries.</p>

<p><strong>Version Control and Collaboration:</strong> I am proficient in using Git, a distributed version control system, to manage source code and collaborate effectively with team members. I have experience with platforms like GitHub and Bitbucket for seamless code sharing and project management.</p>

<p><strong>Testing and Debugging:</strong> I am well-versed in writing unit tests and conducting robust testing processes to ensure the quality and stability of Android applications. I utilize debugging tools and techniques to identify and resolve issues, ensuring optimal app performance.</p>

<p><strong>Continuous Integration and Deployment:</strong> I have experience setting up and managing CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI. This enables smooth integration, automated testing, and streamlined app deployment processes.</p>

<p>By leveraging my technical expertise, I strive to deliver high-quality Android applications that meet clients’ requirements, exceed user expectations, and provide a seamless experience across devices.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yogesh Balan</name><email>me@yogeshbalan.com</email></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Technical Experience]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">About me</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/06/07/about-me.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="About me" /><published>2023-06-07T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2023-06-07T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/06/07/about-me</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/06/07/about-me.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
